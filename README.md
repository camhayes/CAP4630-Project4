# CAP4630-Project4

## Team: Cam Hayes
I propose a research project that explores how effectively machine learning models can predict movie review scores using a combination of structured metadata (e.g., genre, runtime, year) and unstructured sentiment extracted from critic reviews. The goal is to investigate the predictive power of both types of data and compare the performance of two different regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.  
## Problem Statement
Given a dataset from Rotten Tomatoes containing movie metadata and critic review text, I aim to address the following research problem:  
**To what extent can machine learning models accurately predict movie review scores using a combination of structured metadata and unstructured text sentiment**  
I will preprocess the data, engineer features (including sentiment scores), train and evaluate two regression models, and perform a comparative analysis based on model accuracy and feature importance.
## Tools
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* VADER (for sentiment analysis)
* Matplotlib (for visualizations)


TODO: 

Load and clean dataset; extract numerical and categorical metadata

Preprocess critic review text; apply sentiment analysis (VADER/TextBlob)

Merge metadata and sentiment features; prepare training and test sets

Implement and evaluate Linear Regression model

Implement and evaluate Random Forest Regressor; analyze feature importances

Compare model performance; visualize results (scatter plots, importances)

Write final project report; prepare slides and visual assets

Final review, polish, and report formatting

Submit final deliverables
