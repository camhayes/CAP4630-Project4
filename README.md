# CAN4010 Project 4 â€“ Cam Hayes
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance into the components of this project. 

Data:
For the purposes of file transfer, the base dataset is not included with this project, but can be downloaded directly from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset  
Both the rotten_tomatoes_critic_reviews.csv and rotten_tomatoes_movies.csv datasets are used in this project.  

Source Code:  
Project4-collab.ipynb  
This is a compiled Jupyter file containing all of the code used for pre-processing data, sentiment generation, FilmBERT model training, and regression model predictions. This file may be opened using Google Collab, VSCode, and other tools that support Jupyter type files.  
This compiled file is segmented into four sections: Setup, Sentiment Analysis Models, Prediction Testing, FilmBERT Training. There is no need to execute a new runtime for this project, however you may do so by:  
* Running cells 1 and 2 and mounting a drive.
* Changing file reference locations for rotten_tomatoes_critic_reviews.csv and rotten_tomatoes_movies.csv. 
* Running the training and sentiment generating FilmBERT Training cells. 
* Running sentiment generating cells for the remaining models found under Sentiment Analysis Models.
* Running the regression prediction models under Prediction Testing.
