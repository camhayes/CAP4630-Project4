# CAP4630-Project4

## Team: Cam Hayes
I propose a research project that explores how effectively machine learning models can predict movie review scores using a combination of structured metadata (e.g., genre, runtime, year) and unstructured sentiment extracted from critic reviews. The goal is to investigate the predictive power of both types of data and compare the performance of different regression models.
## Problem Statement
Given a dataset from Rotten Tomatoes containing movie metadata and critic review text, I aim to address the following research problem:  
**To what extent can machine learning models accurately predict movie review scores using a combination of structured metadata and unstructured text sentiment**  
I will preprocess the data, engineer features (including sentiment scores), train and evaluate multiple regression models, and perform a comparative analysis based on model accuracy and feature importance.
## Research Questions
* Is review sentiment a sufficient and accuracte enough measure of a movie critic score?
* To what extent does review sentiment and film metadata improve predictive performances over metadata alone?
* To what extent does the designation of Top Critic introduce bias in movie review scoring, and does accounting for that bias improve predictive performance?
## Tools
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* VADER (for sentiment analysis)
* Matplotlib (for visualizations)
